# Data Science Fundamentals

## Introduction
Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.

## The Data Science Process

### 1. Problem Definition
Clearly defining the business problem and determining how data science can help solve it.

### 2. Data Collection
Gathering relevant data from various sources:
- Databases
- APIs
- Web scraping
- Surveys
- Sensors

### 3. Data Cleaning
Preparing data for analysis:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting inconsistencies
- Dealing with outliers

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Understanding the data through:
- Statistical summaries
- Visualizations
- Correlation analysis
- Distribution analysis

### 5. Feature Engineering
Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

### 6. Model Building
Selecting and training appropriate models based on the problem type.

### 7. Model Evaluation
Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

### 8. Deployment
Making the model available for use in production environments.

### 9. Monitoring and Maintenance
Continuously tracking model performance and updating as needed.
