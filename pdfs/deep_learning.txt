# Deep Learning

## Introduction
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.

## Neural Network Fundamentals

### Artificial Neurons
The basic unit of a neural network, inspired by biological neurons. Each neuron:
- Receives multiple inputs
- Applies weights to inputs
- Sums weighted inputs
- Applies an activation function
- Produces an output

### Activation Functions
Non-linear functions that introduce non-linearity into the network:
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
- Sigmoid
- Tanh
- Softmax
- Leaky ReLU

### Backpropagation
The algorithm used to train neural networks by computing gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights.

## Deep Learning Architectures

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images. Key components:
- Convolutional layers
- Pooling layers
- Fully connected layers

Applications:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Image segmentation

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Designed for sequential data with feedback connections. Variants include:
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

Applications:
- Time series prediction
- Speech recognition
- Language modeling

### Transformers
Architecture based on self-attention mechanisms:
- Multi-head attention
- Positional encoding
- Feed-forward networks

Applications:
- Natural language processing
- Machine translation
- Text generation

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Consist of two networks (generator and discriminator) that compete against each other:
- Generator creates fake data
- Discriminator distinguishes real from fake

Applications:
- Image generation
- Style transfer
- Data augmentation

## Training Deep Networks

### Optimization Algorithms
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Adam
- RMSprop
- AdaGrad

### Regularization Techniques
