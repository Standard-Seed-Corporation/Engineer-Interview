# Natural Language Processing

## Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language. NLP draws from many disciplines, including computer science and computational linguistics.

## Core NLP Tasks

### Text Preprocessing
- Tokenization: Breaking text into words, phrases, or other meaningful elements
- Stemming: Reducing words to their root form
- Lemmatization: Converting words to their base or dictionary form
- Stop Words Removal: Eliminating common words that don't carry much meaning

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)
Identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories such as:
- Person names
- Organizations
- Locations
- Dates
- Monetary values

### Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
Assigning parts of speech to each word in a sentence (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).

### Sentiment Analysis
Determining the emotional tone behind words to understand the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed in text.

## Advanced NLP Techniques

### Word Embeddings
Representing words as dense vectors in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are mapped to nearby points.

Popular methods:
- Word2Vec
- GloVe
- FastText

### Transformer Models
State-of-the-art architecture for NLP tasks:
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)

### Sequence-to-Sequence Models
Used for tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

## Applications
- Chatbots and Virtual Assistants
- Machine Translation
- Text Summarization
- Question Answering Systems
- Spam Detection
- Grammar Checking
- Information Extraction

## Challenges
- Ambiguity in language
- Context understanding
- Handling multiple languages
- Sarcasm and irony detection
- Domain-specific terminology
