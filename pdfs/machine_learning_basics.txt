# Machine Learning Basics

## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The model makes predictions or decisions based on input data and is corrected when its predictions are incorrect.

Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. The algorithm tries to find patterns and structures in the data without explicit guidance.

Common algorithms include:
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Autoencoders

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning is about taking suitable actions to maximize reward in a particular situation. It learns through trial and error.

## Key Concepts

### Training and Testing
Data is typically split into training and testing sets. The model learns from the training data and is evaluated on the testing data to assess its performance.

### Overfitting and Underfitting
- Overfitting: The model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
- Underfitting: The model fails to capture the underlying pattern in the data

### Feature Engineering
The process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning.

## Applications
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Fraud Detection
- Autonomous Vehicles
